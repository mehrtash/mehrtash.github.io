        I am a researcher in medical image analysis with
        <a href="http://www.spl.harvard.edu/">Surgical Planning Lab</a> at
        Radiology Department of <a href="https://www.brighamandwomens.org/"> Brigham and Women's Hospital</a>,
        Harvard Medical School.
        I am interested in applying machine learning algorithms including deep learning for analysis of medical
        images, including segmentation and computer-assisted detection and diagnosis,
        with some emphasis on applications in image-guided surgery.
