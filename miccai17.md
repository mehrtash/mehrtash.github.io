### MICCAI 2017: A Survey of Deep Learning Papers
Since 1998 the MICCAI society has brought together researchers working on computational methods to understand medical images and aid interventions. The 20th MICCAI conference was held at Quebec City, Quebec, Canada this September. Like many other conferences in computer science and engineering disciplines, deep learning was the dominating theme of MICCAI 2017. Here, I provide a brief statistics of the papers and a survey of deep learning works presented in the main conference.

**Overview.** Out of 800 submitted papers to the conference 255 papers were accepted, making the acceptance rate 32%. To get an insight of the growing trend in deep learning in medical image analysis let's review the top 20 occurred words in the abstract of the past 5 MICCAI conferences:
