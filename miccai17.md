Since 1998 the MICCAI society has brought together researchers working on computational methods to understand medical images and aid interventions. The 20th MICCAI conference was held at Quebec City, Quebec, Canada this September. Like many other conferences in computer science and engineering disciplines, deep learning was the dominating theme of MICCAI 2017. Here, I provide a brief statistics of the papers and a survey of deep learning works presented in the main conference.
